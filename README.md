🌍🚄 Intergalactic Express: Quantum Railway Database

Welcome to the Intergalactic Express Database, a futuristic schema that captures the inner workings of an international train organization whose operations transcend the limits of classical physics.

This database models the complexities of an ultra-high-speed transport system — including its passengers, employees, routes, and tickets — within a system so advanced, some traditional assumptions about train travel no longer apply.

📘 Overview

This project simulates a sophisticated train system that:

Travels at record-breaking speeds, bordering on relativistic limits
Maintains records for:
🌐 International routes
🎟️ Passenger tickets
🧍 Employee and passenger identities
🗺️ Route-specific travel data
Unlike conventional railway databases, this one is designed to reflect the unique operational rules of quantum-speed locomotion. Prepare to think outside the box — and possibly outside the spacetime continuum.

🧩 Schema Includes

Passengers: Identities, bookings, and travel history.
Employees: Roles, assignments, and regional responsibilities.
Routes: Origin/destination pairs, transit times, and more.
Tickets: Bookings, fare details, and route mappings.

🚀 Why This is Unique

❌ No assumptions about consistent time zones or linear travel.
❌ No reliance on conventional physics — speeds and stops may vary non-linearly.
✅ Full support for future-forward concepts like time folding, multi-hop teleportation, and asynchronous boarding.
